    "# Credit Card Fraud Dataset\n",
    "## About The Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is very popular for all kinds of machine learning cyber security techniques. This dataset contains simulated credit card transactions with legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It covers credit cards of over 1000 customers transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Details:\n",
    "Number of Instances: The dataset consists of 1.3 million instances.\n",
    "Number of Features: There are 23 different features that help describe the inidividual transactions making them all unique.\n",
    "Target Variable: The target variable in the dataset is is_fraud, representing the if the transaction actually was fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types:\n",
    "The features include both numerical and categorical variables.\n",
    "They cover a wide range of aspects such as transaction time, credit card number, zip code of the transaction, merchant details and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "The Credit Card Fraud Dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for:\n",
    "- Cyber Security\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Modeling: Predicting likelyhood that a transaction is Fraudulent\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Developing and testing new techniques to handle numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "Predictive Analytics: Analyzing previous transactions and predicting if a transaction is fraudulent."

    "In order to make sure that the model is able to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not I needed to split up the data into testing and training data. As the dataset was so large (1.2 million entries) I needed to first, shrink the dataset to make sure that the model worked on a smaller dataset. Also, as fraudlent transactions are much less frequent than non fraudulent ones I needed to make sure that the training set had at least roughly 10% fraudulent transactions to make sure than the model knew the base case for fraudulent transactions. Once this was completed I was able to split it up into the training and testing sets. "

    "In order to test the model and analyze what it does excellently versus where the model lacks I calculate the accuracy, precision and recall. The overall accuracy of the model was a staggering 96.33% which is the total correct predictions of all of the tests. I do want to mention that as the dataset is imbalanced this may play a role in why the accuracy is so high. Next I analyzed the precision which was 79.79% which is still extremely high as this means that for all of positives it got almost 80% of them correct. After that I analyzed the recall of the model which ended up being 75%. This is an ok recall as these are the actual positive cases, but more importantly this indicates that there are a lot of false negatives which means that the model is explaining that the model is flagging more cases that are not fraud which is much better than the opposite."
